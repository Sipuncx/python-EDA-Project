# Python Project (Exploring Diwali sales trends)
The dataset used in this analysis includes sales data from a popular retail store during the Diwali festive season.
Exploratory data analysis techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization were employed to gain a better understanding of the data.
Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots were used to identify relationships between variables and detect outliers.
